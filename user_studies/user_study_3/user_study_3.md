# User Study Round 3
We performed this study using a working implementation of our language, which allowed
participants to run their code while developing, and see what results it produced
 in real time. We also had one participant that was relatively new to programming,
 having only completed minimal school assignments in the R language.
## Findings

**Key feedback received:**
1. Worked Well
    - Fixed literals helped explain the purpose of statements - e.g. the `titled`
     keyword makes it obvious that the following string modifies the plot title.
    - Syntax and requirements are consistent with other languages.
    - Exciting to see visual results with a short development time.
2. Still needs improvement
    - Implementation is buggy - e.g. displays more points than it should.
    - Lack of syntax highlighting while developing leads to confusion.
    - It is unclear how multiple elements of the program (e.g. multiple sources) 
    interact.
